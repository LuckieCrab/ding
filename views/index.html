    <h1>21 Cars</h1>
    <p><strong>Eric, they stole 21 cars.</strong> Can you believe that? What? <strong>21 cars?</strong> They could have gave me a car. 21 cars, what are they going to do? How are they going to drive 21 cars? At once. Right. That's crazy.</p>

    <p>They ought to be ashamed of theyself. I've been telling the <strong>E-Fault mania</strong> to get your life together. 21 cars? Where are you going to park all them cars? You can't do it. I don't know what's going on.</p>

    <p><strong>E-Fault</strong> need to get theyself together out here. It's too hot to be driving 21 cars. Yeah. I said, that's too much gas money. How you going to use all them cars? That's crazy. <strong>I hope they find them 21 cars.</strong></p>
